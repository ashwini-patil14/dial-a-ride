-> My approach for solving dial a ride:
1. Solved the example given in the question pdf manually
2. Broken down the problem in 2 parts:
	a. Forming a RequestGroup of all the compatible Requests which can be serviced together
	b. Assigning cab to each RequestGroup
3. Successfully implemented the code for the smaller example given in the question
4. Made modifications to accomodate all the cases (such as pick up time not going beyond 1440) of the bigger example.

->My algorithm for Dial a Ride

1. Start with Reading the input file ->(Requests, distance matrix, locations read in 2*2 matrices)
2. Find all pair shortest path matrix and pathFrom matrix using Floyd Warshall

3.Request and RequestGroup
	a. Request object contains details of each request such as reqNo, source, destination, start time, end time, cost achieved if it is 		served
	b.RequestGroup objects act like a container of Requests and also stores the smallestEndTime and largestStartTime of all the request 		in that group.
	
4. Process the request matrix and form requestGroups as:
	a. Sort Request matrix in ascending order of source-> if same source then endTime-> if same source and endTime then Destination
	b. Form RequestGroup objects that contain maximum number of request which are compatible (Picked from the same source and having 		overlapping interval).
	c. Each RequestGroup object does not contain more than cab capacity no. of requests. 

5. Cab and CabPath classes:
Cab contains head of the CabPath linked list , total revenue generated by the cab, the requestGroups which the cab serviced.
CabPath is a linkedList and contains the details of location, time, capcity used, request no. serviced by its container cab

6. AssignCab
This methods in this class are used for assigning cabs to RequestGroup
1. RequestGroups are sorted according to smallestEndTime and largestStartTime
2. For each RequestGroup
	a. The closest available and reachable cab at that moment of time, which can accomodate the capacity of the given RequestGroup is 		found
	b. The node in CabPath after which the pick up of the present requestGroup might be added is found and the newNode with appropriate 		details of pick-up of the RequestGroup is inserted in the CabPath linked list.
	c. The capacity and timing of other CabPath nodes after the newNode are adjusted as required
	d. Also the next nodes are checked to see if any drops of the present requestGroup are already covered by them, the capacity is 	adjusted accordingly.
	e. The remaining drops of the presently inserted RequestGroup would be serviced after the drops of earlier RequestGroups in the 	CabPath list
	f. For all the cases, the pathFrom matrix is used to have the complete path between any 2 nodes saved in the CabPath list
3. The requestGroups which cannot be served by any cab at the given time are skipped
